## üìã **Executive Summary**

Finkargo transforms supply chain data chaos into actionable intelligence in 30 seconds. We solve the critical problem of fragmented, unstructured supply chain data that prevents companies from making informed decisions about inventory, cash flow, and supplier relationships.

**Core Value Proposition**: Upload any supply chain file (CSV, Excel, PDF, images) and get CEO-level insights instantly, with AI-powered recommendations that drive immediate business impact.

## üéØ **The Problem We Solve**

### **The Supply Chain Data Crisis**

Every day, supply chain managers face three critical questions they can't answer:

1. **"What am I selling, to whom, where and how much?"**
2. **"What's the real cost of my inventory and how is my cash flow trapped?"**  
3. **"When do I need to purchase from which supplier, and how healthy is my supply chain?"**

### **Current State Pain Points**

- **üìÅ Data Fragmentation**: Information scattered across emails, WhatsApp, Excel files, and disconnected systems
- **‚è∞ Time Waste**: 3-4 weeks average time to get basic insights from supply chain data
- **üí∞ Financial Impact**: $1.1 trillion trapped in supply chain inefficiencies globally
- **üéØ Decision Paralysis**: 89% of companies still use manual Excel for critical decisions
- **üö® Risk Blindness**: 23% of bankruptcies caused by poor inventory management
- **üîó Communication Gaps**: Teams work in silos with no unified view of supply chain health

### **The Formula Dependency Problem**

Companies rely on complex Google Sheets formulas that are:
- **Fragile**: Break when data formats change
- **Single-point-of-failure**: Only one person understands them
- **Error-prone**: Manual calculations lead to costly mistakes
- **Non-scalable**: Can't handle growing data volumes

              /  \
             /    \

            \      /
             \    /
              \  /
               \/
         DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE
         (Compliance/Visibility)
```
