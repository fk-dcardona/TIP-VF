## ðŸŽ¬ FULL DEMO SCRIPT (2:30 Total)

### Scene 1: The Hook (0:00-0:10)
**[Full screen face shot]**

"What if I told you that your supply chain spreadsheets are hiding millions of dollars? And that AI can find it in just 30 seconds? Let me show you exactly how."

**[Transition to screen share]**

---

### Scene 2: The Problem (0:10-0:30)
**[Show cluttered desktop with multiple Excel files open]**

"This is how most supply chain teams work today. Drowning in spreadsheets, multiple versions, endless formulas. The average team spends 73% of their time just preparing data for analysis."

**[Highlight different Excel tabs]**

"Inventory here, suppliers there, sales data somewhere else. By the time you finish analyzing, the data is already outdated. And somewhere in these files, there's typically 2.3 million dollars in trapped working capital."

**[Pause dramatically]**

"But what if there was a better way?"

---

### Scene 3: Enter FinKargo (0:30-0:40)
**[Navigate to finkargo.ai]**

"This is FinKargo. Your AI-powered supply chain intelligence platform. Instead of weeks of analysis, you get CEO-level insights in seconds."

**[Click on Dashboard]**

"Let me show you the magic."

---

### Scene 4: The Upload (0:40-0:55)
**[Navigate to /dashboard/upload]**

"It starts with a simple upload. You can drag and drop any inventory CSV or Excel file."

**[Drag sample_inventory.csv from desktop]**

"I'm using a sample inventory file here, but this works with your real data - purchase orders, sales history, supplier lists - any supply chain data you have."

**[Show upload progress]**

"Watch what happens next..."

---

### Scene 5: AI Analysis (0:55-1:10)
**[Processing animation plays]**

"Our AI is now analyzing your data across 15 different intelligence dimensions. It's looking for patterns humans miss, opportunities hidden in the numbers, risks you haven't seen yet."

**[Analytics start appearing]**

"In traditional consulting, this analysis would take 3-4 weeks and cost tens of thousands. Here, it's happening in real-time."

---

### Scene 6: The Insights Revealed (1:10-2:00)
**[Show main analytics dashboard]**

"And here's where the magic happens. In seconds, you get:"

**[Click through each section quickly]**

"**Customer Intelligence** - See exactly who's buying what, where your growth opportunities are hiding."

**[Point to specific insight]**

"Look, it's already identified that 23% of your revenue comes from just 3 customers. That's a risk you need to manage."

**[Scroll to geographic map]**

"**Geographic patterns** you've never noticed. This heat map shows untapped markets where your competitors aren't serving."

**[Click on pricing optimization]**

"**AI-powered pricing recommendations**. It's found products where you're leaving money on the table - a 12% price increase here wouldn't affect demand."

**[Navigate to cash flow analysis]**

"But here's the million-dollar insight - literally. **Your trapped cash analysis**. See this? $2.3 million tied up in slow-moving inventory. That's cash you could be using to grow your business."

**[Show predictive reordering]**

"And it doesn't just show problems - it solves them. **Predictive reordering** tells you exactly when to order from which supplier to avoid stockouts while minimizing carrying costs."

**[Quick scroll through other features]**

"Supplier risk scores, lead time optimization, seasonal patterns - everything you need to make confident decisions, instantly available."

### Scene 7: The Value Prop (2:00-2:20)
**[Return to face shot with dashboard in background]**

"One of our customers discovered 2.3 million dollars in trapped working capital in their first upload. Another prevented a critical stockout that would have lost them their biggest customer."

**[Lean into camera]**

"This isn't just another analytics tool. This is your AI supply chain advisor, working 24/7 to find opportunities and prevent disasters."
