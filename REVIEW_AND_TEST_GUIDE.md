# üîç Review & Testing Guide for Archaeological Refactoring

## 1. Git Review Commands

### View All Changes
```bash
# See the summary of changes
git log --oneline refactor/archaeological-cleanup-execution ^main

# View detailed diff
git diff main refactor/archaeological-cleanup-execution --stat

# See what was moved to archive
git diff main refactor/archaeological-cleanup-execution --name-status | grep "^D"

# Review archive structure
ls -la development-archive/
```

### Verify No Production Files Were Modified
```bash
# Check critical production files remain unchanged
git diff main refactor/archaeological-cleanup-execution -- src/ main.py models.py routes/

# Should show NO changes to these files
```

## 2. Pre-Merge Testing Checklist

### A. Frontend Testing
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Run development server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000 and test:
# - [ ] Homepage loads
# - [ ] Authentication works (sign in/out)
# - [ ] Dashboard pages load
# - [ ] Living Interface animations work

# 3. Type checking
npm run type-check

# 4. Linting
npm run lint

# 5. Production build (may have issues with Next.js 15)
npm run build
```

### B. Backend Testing
```bash
# 1. Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv_test
source venv_test/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_test\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run backend
python main.py
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# 4. Test key endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/ready
```

### C. Integration Testing
```bash
# With both frontend and backend running:
# 1. Upload a test CSV file
# 2. Check analytics components load data
# 3. Verify API calls work from frontend
```

## 3. Verification Checklist

### Structure Verification
- [ ] Root directory has ~30 files (down from ~100)
- [ ] Only 5 .md files in root (README, CLAUDE, DEPLOYMENT*, CONTRIBUTING)
- [ ] No duplicate "Supply Chain B2B SaaS Product" directory
- [ ] development-archive/ contains all historical files

### Production File Integrity
- [ ] src/ directory intact
- [ ] All Python files (main.py, models.py, etc.) present
- [ ] package.json and requirements.txt in root
- [ ] All deployment configs present

### Archive Completeness
```bash
# Verify archive contents
ls development-archive/sessions/        # Should have DANIEL_SESSIONS
ls development-archive/experiments/     # Should have test files
ls development-archive/docs-history/    # Should have 40+ docs
ls development-archive/legacy-code/     # Should have agent_protocol
```

## 4. Safe Merge Process

### Step 1: Final Review
```bash
# Review one more time
git checkout main
git checkout -b review/pre-merge-check
git merge refactor/archaeological-cleanup-execution --no-commit --no-ff
git status

# If everything looks good, abort this test merge
git merge --abort
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Create Backup Tag
```bash
git tag "pre-merge-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
```

### Step 3: Perform the Merge
```bash
git checkout main
git merge refactor/archaeological-cleanup-execution
```

### Step 4: Post-Merge Verification
```bash
# Immediately test
npm run dev          # Frontend
python main.py       # Backend (in another terminal)

# Check production is unaffected
curl https://finkargo.ai  # Should still work
```

## 5. Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If anything goes wrong:
```bash
# Option 1: Reset to pre-merge state
git reset --hard pre-merge-backup-[timestamp]

# Option 2: Revert to backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-refactor-complete-state
git checkout -b main-recovery
```

## 6. What You're Looking For

### ‚úÖ Good Signs
- Clean, organized root directory
- All production code intact
- Clear separation of active vs archived files
- Comprehensive preservation in development-archive/
- Application runs without issues

### üö® Red Flags
- Any missing production files
- Build or runtime errors
- Broken imports or dependencies
- Missing environment configurations
- API endpoints not responding

## 7. Quick Validation Script

Create and run this script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Production File Check ==="
[ -d "src" ] && echo "‚úÖ src/ exists" || echo "‚ùå src/ missing"
[ -f "main.py" ] && echo "‚úÖ main.py exists" || echo "‚ùå main.py missing"
[ -f "package.json" ] && echo "‚úÖ package.json exists" || echo "‚ùå package.json missing"

echo -e "\n=== Documentation Check ==="
ls *.md | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "üìÑ {} markdown files in root"

echo -e "\n=== Archive Check ==="
[ -d "development-archive" ] && echo "‚úÖ Archive exists" || echo "‚ùå Archive missing"

echo -e "\n=== Build Test ==="
npm run type-check && echo "‚úÖ TypeScript OK" || echo "‚ùå TypeScript errors"
```

**Remember**: The production site at `finkargo.ai` is completely unaffected by these local changes until you deploy them.
