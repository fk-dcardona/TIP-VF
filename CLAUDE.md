**Backend**: Flask API with comprehensive analytics endpoints  
**Deployment**: Production-ready with DevOps infrastructure  
**Status**: Full-stack supply chain intelligence platform operational

**Latest Update**: January 15, 2025 - Complete CI/CD automation and branch consolidation

### Current Development Status

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows configured and operational
- **Deployment**: Automated deployments on push to main branch

## Repository Overview

Supply Chain B2B SaaS MVP - a comprehensive, AI-powered supply chain intelligence platform built with Next.js 14 and Flask. Features include 15 advanced business intelligence components covering sales, financial, and supply chain analytics with real-time visualizations, predictive modeling, interactive dashboards, and revolutionary "Living Interface" organic animations.

**Live Platform**: `https://finkargo.ai` 🌐 (SSL Active)
**Vercel Domain**: `https://tip-vf-daniel-cardonas-projects-6f697727.vercel.app`
**Backend API**: `https://tip-vf-production.up.railway.app/api`

## High-Level Architecture

### Three-Layer Architecture Pattern
1. **Presentation Layer** (Next.js/React)
   - Role-based dashboards (Sales, Finance, Procurement)
   - 15 business intelligence components with organic animations
   - Enhanced API client with retry logic and caching

2. **Business Logic Layer** (Services & Utilities)
   - Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
   - Living Interface system with Framer Motion animations
   - Multi-tenant organization scoping via Clerk

3. **Data Layer** (Flask API + PostgreSQL)
   - RESTful API endpoints with JWT authentication
   - Supply Chain Triangle Engine for analytics
   - Agent Astra integration for document intelligence

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Multi-tenant**: Organization-scoped data isolation using Clerk
- **API Proxy**: Vercel rewrites `/api/*` to Railway backend
- **Living Interface**: Organic animations respecting accessibility
- **Enhanced API Client**: Automatic retry, caching, and deduplication
- **TypeScript**: Relaxed strictness for faster development

### Environment Configuration
All projects use `.env` files with these critical variables:
```bash
# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api  # Development
# Production: Set in Vercel dashboard

# Backend (.env)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # or sqlite:///
AGENT_ASTRA_API_KEY=aa_...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Vercel Deployment Error
**Issue**: "Error: 🚀 Supply Chain B2B SaaS - Vercel Deployment Script" in Vercel logs
**Cause**: The interactive deployment script (`scripts/deploy-vercel.sh`) is being run in Vercel's build environment
**Solution**: 
- Remove any reference to this script from Vercel's build command
- Use the script only for local deployments
- Let Vercel handle the build with its default Next.js configuration

### Environment Variables
**Issue**: API calls failing in production
**Solution**: Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://tip-vf-production.up.railway.app/api`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = Your Clerk public key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` = Your Clerk secret key

### Build Warnings
**Issue**: ESLint warnings about React Hook dependencies
**Status**: Non-critical - these are minor optimization suggestions
**Solution**: Can be addressed later; they don't affect functionality

### Next.js Version Warning
**Issue**: Clerk warning about Next.js 14.0.0 deprecation
**Status**: Non-critical - application works fine
**Solution**: Update to Next.js 14.1.0+ when convenient
