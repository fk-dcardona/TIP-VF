## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### **SOLID Principles Applied**

#### **Single Responsibility Principle** ✅
- `CSVAnalyticsProvider`: Only handles CSV upload and validation
- `useCSVUpload`: Only manages CSV upload workflow state
- `EnhancedUploadWizard`: Only renders CSV upload UI components
- `SupplyChainAnalyticsEngine`: Only processes inventory/sales analytics

#### **Open/Closed Principle** ✅  
- Existing `SolidAnalyticsService` extended without modification
- New CSV provider added without changing existing providers
- Dashboard extended with new tab without modifying existing tabs

#### **Liskov Substitution Principle** ✅
- `CSVAnalyticsProvider` implements same interface as other providers
- Can be used interchangeably in `AnalyticsServiceFactory`
- Maintains same contract for `getAnalytics()` method

#### **Interface Segregation Principle** ✅
- `CSVAnalyticsProvider` only implements CSV-specific methods
- Upload-specific interfaces separate from general analytics interfaces
- Clean separation between validation, upload, and processing concerns

#### **Dependency Inversion Principle** ✅
- High-level `SolidAnalyticsService` depends on `AnalyticsProvider` abstraction
- Low-level `CSVAnalyticsProvider` implements the abstraction
- Configuration injected through factory pattern
