# 🎯 Session 001: Sunday Night Deployment
*Date: Sunday 2 AM | Goal: Ship by Monday*

## 🧩 Where We Are (In Lego Terms)

### Your Lego Set Status:
- **Frontend (The Display Window)**: 85% built ✅
  - Like a Lego storefront that customers see
  - Built with: Next.js (think WordPress but for apps)
  - Location: Everything in the `src` folder
  
- **Backend (The Storage Room)**: 70% built 🟡
  - Like the back room where inventory is stored
  - Built with: Python Flask (a simple web server)
  - Location: Files ending in `.py` in root folder
  
- **Database (The Instruction Manual)**: 90% ready ✅
  - Like the filing cabinet that remembers everything
  - Currently using: SQLite (a simple notepad)
  - Need to upgrade to: PostgreSQL (a proper filing system)

## 🏗️ What's Not Connected Yet

### The Missing Lego Pieces:
1. **Security Guard** (Authentication)
   - Right now: Anyone can walk into any store
   - Need: Check IDs at the door
   - Fix: Add Clerk (the ID checker) to all doors

2. **Store Signs** (URLs)
   - Right now: Signs say "localhost" (like "my house")
   - Need: Real addresses for the internet
   - Fix: Change all "localhost" to environment variables

3. **Cash Register** (API Connection)
   - Right now: Frontend can't talk to backend properly
   - Need: Secure phone line between them
   - Fix: Add organization ID to all conversations

## 📍 Where Things Actually Live

### Your APIs (The Talking Points):
- **Currently**: On your computer (localhost:5000)
- **Monday**: Need to be on Railway.app (like a parking spot on the internet)
- **What they do**: 
  - `/api/upload` - Receives files
  - `/api/analytics` - Calculates numbers
  - `/api/documents` - Processes papers

### Your Website:
- **Currently**: On your computer (localhost:3000)
- **Monday**: Will be on Vercel.com (like a billboard on the internet)

## 🎮 Your Three Terminals (Like TV Channels)

### Terminal 1 - Frontend Channel
```bash
# This is where the pretty stuff happens
# Location: src folder
# Language: JavaScript/React
# What to type: npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2 - Backend Channel  
```bash
# This is where the math happens
# Location: root folder (where you see .py files)
# Language: Python
# What to type: python main.py
```

### Terminal 3 - Deployment Channel
```bash
# This is where we put it on the internet
# What we'll do: Copy everything to Vercel & Railway
# What to type: We'll do this together
```

## 🛠️ What We Need to Fix (In Order)

### 1. The Security Guard Problem
**What's wrong**: Anyone can see anyone's data
**The fix**: Like putting name tags on everything
**Where**: Files that talk to the database

### 2. The Address Problem  
**What's wrong**: Everything points to your computer
**The fix**: Like changing "my house" to real street addresses
**Where**: Anywhere you see "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"

### 3. The Filing System Upgrade
**What's wrong**: Using a notepad instead of a real database
**The fix**: Like moving from sticky notes to a filing cabinet
**Where**: The database configuration

## 💬 How to Talk to Me (Claude)

### Instead of Technical Terms:

❌ "Fix the API endpoint authentication"
✅ "Make sure only the right people can see their own data"

❌ "Implement CORS headers"
✅ "Let the website talk to the server safely"

❌ "Add middleware for JWT validation"
✅ "Check everyone's ID before letting them in"

### The Magic Formula:
1. **What's broken**: "Users can see other people's data"
2. **Where it happens**: "When they click view analytics"
3. **What should happen**: "They should only see their own"
4. **Any error messages**: "Copy paste the red text"

## 📝 Today's Game Plan

### Hour 1: Fix the Security Guard
- Add ID checking to all doors
- Make sure each store only shows its own stuff

### Hour 2: Change the Addresses
- Replace "my computer" with "internet address"
- Make sure front and back can talk

### Hour 3: Test Everything
- Upload a pretend document
- Make sure it processes
- Check that data stays separate

### Hour 4: Put it Online
- Copy frontend to Vercel (the billboard)
- Copy backend to Railway (the warehouse)
- Connect them together

## 🚨 When You Get Stuck

### The "Help Me" Template:
```
"I clicked [what button]
I expected [what to happen]
Instead [what actually happened]
The screen shows [error or weird behavior]"
```

### Common Issues Translated:
- **"Cannot connect"** = Front and back can't talk
- **"401 Unauthorized"** = ID check failed
- **"500 Error"** = Something broke in the back room
- **"404 Not Found"** = Wrong address/page doesn't exist

## 🎯 Success Looks Like

By Monday morning:
1. ✅ You can log in with Clerk
2. ✅ You see only your organization's data
3. ✅ You can upload a document
4. ✅ The triangle scores calculate
5. ✅ It works on the internet (not just your computer)

## 📌 Quick Reference Card

### Terminal Commands You'll Use:
```bash
# Terminal 1 (Frontend):
npm run dev          # Start local development
npm run build        # Prepare for internet
npm run start        # Test the built version

# Terminal 2 (Backend):
python main.py       # Start the server
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install missing pieces

# Terminal 3 (Deployment):
vercel               # Put frontend online
railway login        # Log into Railway
railway up           # Put backend online
```

### Files You'll Touch Most:
- `.env.local` - Where we put secret passwords
- `src/lib/api.ts` - How frontend talks to backend
- `main.py` - The backend's front door
- `models.py` - The database structure

*Remember: We're building with Lego blocks. Some are connected, some need connecting. By Monday, we'll have a working store!*
