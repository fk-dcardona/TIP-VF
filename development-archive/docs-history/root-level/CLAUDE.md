## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (use legacy peer deps for Framer Motion compatibility)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint
```

### Backend Development
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv311/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv311\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run development server
python main.py
```

### Key Architecture Patterns

1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Next.js frontend with Flask backend API
   - Frontend runs on port 3000 (development)
   - Backend API runs on port 5000
   - CORS configured for cross-origin requests
   - Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` connects them

2. **Multi-Tenant Organization Support**: Clerk-based organization management
   - Organization-scoped data isolation
   - Role-based dashboards within organizations
   - Clerk organization IDs used as foreign keys
