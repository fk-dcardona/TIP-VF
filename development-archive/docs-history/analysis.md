# Supply Chain B2B SaaS MVP Analysis

## Initial Repository Access Issue
- The GitHub repository URL https://github.com/fk-dcardona/MVP-SPI returns a 404 "Page not found" error
- This could indicate:
  1. The repository is private and requires authentication
  2. The repository name or URL has changed
  3. The repository has been deleted or moved
  4. There's a typo in the URL

## Next Steps
- Need to verify the correct repository URL with the user
- May need to request access if the repository is private
- Alternative: User could provide repository access or share the code directly

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Additional**: Twilio for WhatsApp integration, various data processing libraries

### Current Authentication Issues Identified

1. **Environment Variables Configuration**
   - `.env.local` has placeholder values for some keys (SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY shows "your_supabase_service_key_here")
   - Multiple duplicate entries for SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
   - Some API keys may be invalid or expired

2. **Login Flow Problems**
   - LoginForm.tsx has complex logic with both password and OTP modes
   - Hard-coded redirect to `/dashboard-client` instead of `/dashboard`
   - Inconsistent routing between different authentication methods
   - Console logging suggests debugging authentication issues

3. **Middleware Configuration**
   - Middleware protects `/dashboard` routes but login redirects to `/dashboard-client`
   - Route mismatch could cause authentication loops

4. **User Flow Issues**
   - Main page redirects directly to `/login` with no landing page
   - Multiple authentication methods (password, OTP, email link) may confuse users
   - No clear onboarding flow for new users

### Core Features Structure
- **CSV Upload**: `/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
- **Dashboard**: `/src/app/dashboard/` (multiple components)
- **AI Agents**: `/src/app/api/agents/` (comprehensive agent system)

### Key Problems to Address
1. Fix environment variable configuration
2. Resolve routing inconsistencies
3. Simplify authentication flow
4. Improve user onboarding experience
5. Test core functionality (CSV upload, dashboards, AI agents)


## Authentication Issues Identified

### 1. JavaScript Error in LoginForm Component
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"
- Location: LoginForm.tsx line 8
- This appears to be a webpack/module loading issue
- Likely related to component imports or dependencies

### 2. Registration Flow Issues
- Registration appears to work (shows success message)
- But login page crashes with JavaScript error
- This suggests the authentication system backend is working but frontend has issues

### 3. Routing Problems
- Login redirects to `/dashboard-client` but middleware protects `/dashboard`
- This mismatch could cause authentication loops

### 4. User Experience Issues
- Multiple authentication methods (password, OTP, email link) may confuse users
- No clear onboarding flow after registration
- Error handling is not user-friendly

### Next Steps for Debugging
1. Fix the JavaScript error in LoginForm component
2. Align routing between login redirect and middleware protection
3. Simplify authentication flow
4. Improve error handling and user feedback
