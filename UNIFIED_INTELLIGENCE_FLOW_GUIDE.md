## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### **Step 1: File Upload**
```
User drags/drops or selects file
↓
System detects file type (CSV/Excel vs PDF/Image)
↓
Real-time feedback: "Processing CSV data..." or "Extracting document intelligence..."
```

### **Step 2: Processing Feedback**
```
📤 File uploaded successfully
📊 Processing CSV/Excel data (for structured files)
📄 Processing document with Agent Astra (for documents)
🔍 Cross-referencing data sources
✅ Processing complete!
```

### **Step 3: Results Display**
```
🎯 4D Intelligence Triangle (Service, Cost, Capital, Document scores)
🚨 Real-time Alerts (if any compromised inventory detected)
📊 Compromised Inventory Analysis
📋 Tabbed Intelligence Results (Overview, Analytics, Documents, Recommendations)
```

- Take action buttons
- Dismiss functionality

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

### **Test Files Created**
```bash
# Run the test script
node test-unified-intelligence.js

# This creates:
test-files/test-inventory.csv
```

### **Test Steps**
1. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Start backend: `python -m flask run --port=5000`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/upload`
4. Upload: `test-files/test-inventory.csv`
5. Verify: All intelligence components display correctly

### **Expected Results**
- ✅ Real-time processing feedback
- ✅ 4D Triangle score display
- ✅ Compromised inventory analysis
- ✅ Real-time alerts (if any)
- ✅ Tabbed intelligence results
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
